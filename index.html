        <h5>How to play?(instructions):</h5>
        <p>
          For many years, players of all ages have delighted in the timeless
          casual game Whack-a-Gopher. The goal of the game is to hammer as many
          moles as you can; but, if you happen to hit the bomb, the game is
          over. Moles and bombs randomly appear out of holes in a board that is
          used to play the game. To hit the moles as they appear, players need
          quick reflexes and good hand-eye coordination.
        </p>

        <p>
          The player must wait for the moles to emerge from their holes as the
          game begins with them hidden within. Once a mole appears, the player
          must use the mallet to strike it fast before it retreats back into its
          hole.The player receives 10+ points for each mole struck, and the game
          is over when you unintentionally hit a bomb. The player with the most
          points at the conclusion of the game week is declared the overall
          champion, and the score should be posted on Twitter.
        </p>

        <p>
          The simplicity of Whack-a-Gopher is one of its best features. Everyone
          of any age or ability level can enjoy the game because it is simple to
          learn and play. It is also very replayable because it is difficult to
          predict when and where the moles and explosives will come because they
          appear in different holes and at varied intervals.
        </p>

        <p>
          In general, Whack-a-Gopher is a time-tested classic that has endured.
          Its straightforward yet difficult gameplay makes it a game that
          players of all ages and backgrounds may enjoy. It's a game that never
          gets old and gives gamers all across the world hours of entertainment.
